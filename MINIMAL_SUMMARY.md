# MINIMAL Django Repository

## What's Included (Complete ML System)

**Total Size: 6.46 MB** - Perfect for GitHub!

### Core Django Framework
- `agrihield_django/` - Django project configuration
- `pest_detection/` - Pest detection Django app with ML inference
- `pest_forecasting/` - Pest forecasting Django app
- `ml_training/` - **COMPLETE ML training system** with admin interface
- `manage.py` - Django management script

### Essential Files
- `ml_models/pest_detection/best.pt` - Trained YOLO model (6MB)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `setup.py` - Simple setup script
- `README.md` - Basic documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## What Was Removed

### Documentation (Reduced to single README)
